# Quantum stack
The purpose of this repo is to host relevant material for understandin the quantum computing stack across many levels. All resources have been generated with the help of a generative AI model and then curated by a human for accuracy. The idea is to cover as many level as possible of the quantum stack, explaining with basic concept and conveying physical intuition and understanding alongside and accurate and detailed mathematical derivation

The current plan is to cover the following topics:
- Superconductivity (?)
- Josephson junction qubits
- Qubit types
- Measurement and control of superconducting qubits
- Qubit properties characterization
- Calibration of qubit controls
- Error suppression
- Error mitigation
- Error detection
- Error correction (?)
- Quantum sub-routines (fundamental components of quantum algorithms)
- Quantum algorithms
- Simulation of quantum systems:
    - many-body physics
    - quantum chemistry
    - material science
    - high energy physics
