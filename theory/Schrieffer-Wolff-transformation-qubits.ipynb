    "# Chapter 2: Transmon Qubits in Cavity QED\n",
    "\n",
    "Superconducting qubits are promising physical realizations of quantum bits. These devices are electrical circuits made of superconducting elements (capacitors, inductors, and Josephson junctions) with quantized energy levels and very low dissipation. Interestingly, the physics of such circuits closely parallels that of **cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED)**, which deals with atoms interacting with quantized electromagnetic modes in a cavity. In this chapter, we introduce the basic cavity QED model (the Jaynes-Cummings model) and then describe how it is implemented in superconducting circuits (circuit QED) with a focus on the transmon qubit. We will see how the transmon's low anharmonicity necessitates treating higher energy levels and how coupling a transmon to a resonator leads to important effects like **dispersive shifts**, which we will derive perturbatively.\n",

    "## 2.1 Cavity QED and the Jaynes–Cummings Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cavity QED** studies the interaction between atoms and the electromagnetic field inside a reflective cavity. A cavity resonator supports discrete electromagnetic modes (standing waves), so that an atom inside interacts predominantly with these quantized modes of specific resonant frequencies. Photons emitted by the atom are confined in the cavity and can be reabsorbed, leading to coherent oscillations (Rabi oscillations) between atomic states and photon states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a single mode of the cavity field with frequency $\\omega_c$ is described as a quantum harmonic oscillator. Its Hamiltonian is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{\\text{field}} = \\omega_c \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\,,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a^\\dagger$ and $a$ are the photon creation and annihilation operators for the mode, satisfying $[a, a^\\dagger] = 1$. We will often drop the constant vacuum energy term $\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_c$, since it only adds an irrelevant global energy offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider an atom with two energy levels (a qubit-like two-level atom) interacting with this single cavity mode. Let $|0\\rangle$ denote the atomic ground state and $|1\\rangle$ the excited state, with transition frequency $\\omega_a$. The Hamiltonian of the isolated two-level atom can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{\\text{atom}} = -\\frac{\\omega_a}{2}\\,\\sigma_z \\,,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma_z = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| - |1\\rangle\\langle 1|$ is the Pauli $Z$ operator for the two-level system (with eigenvalues $+1$ on $|0\\rangle$ and $-1$ on $|1\\rangle$). The atom’s ground state has energy $-,\\omega_a/2$ and the excited state $+\\omega_a/2$ under this Hamiltonian, so that $\\omega_a$ indeed represents the energy splitting between $|1\\rangle$ and $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the atom is coupled to the cavity field mode, the total Hamiltonian is often modeled by the **Jaynes–Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian**, which includes a dipole-like interaction term. The full system Hamiltonian (prior to making any approximations) can be written as:\n",
    "\n",

Specifically, an $a^\\dagger \\sigma_-$ term corresponds to the atom de-exciting (|1〉→|0〉) and emitting a photon into the field mode (photon creation $a^\\dagger$), while an $a,\\sigma_+$ term corresponds to the atom being excited (|0〉→|1〉) by absorbing a photon from the field (photon annihilation $a$).\n",

Concretely, from the above expressions one can read off that the cavity mode frequency $\\omega_c$ is *renormalized* to $\\omega_c + \\chi$ when the atom is in $|0\\rangle$, but to $\\omega_c - \\chi$ when the atom is in $|1\\rangle$, where\n",

A simple LC oscillator circuit is not suitable as a qubit because its energy levels are equally spaced (harmonic oscillator); if we tried to use two levels of a harmonic oscillator as |0〉 and |1〉, any drive resonant with the 0→1 transition would also excite 1→2, 2→3, etc., making it impossible to address only two levels. We need an **anharmonic** oscillator—one with unequal level spacings—so that one pair of levels can serve as a qubit distinct from higher levels. This is achieved by introducing a **Josephson junction** into the circuit.\n",

    "A **Josephson junction** consists of two superconductors separated by a thin insulating barrier through which Cooper pairs (paired superconducting electrons) can quantum tunnel. The junction acts as a nonlinear inductor with inductance depending on current/phase, providing the needed anharmonicity.

    "\n",
    "In a Cooper pair box (CPB), we have a small superconducting island connected via a Josephson junction (with Josephson energy $E_J$) to a superconducting reservoir, and the island also has a capacitance $C$ to ground (and often a gate capacitance $C_g$ to a voltage source to tune the charge). The relevant degrees of freedom are the number $n$ of Cooper pairs on the island (which is related to charge $q = -2en$ on the island) and the superconducting phase difference $\\varphi$ across the junction. The CPB Hamiltonian can be written as:\n",

The first term $4E_C (n-n_g)^2$ is the electrostatic energy (parabolic in $n$) and the second term $-E_J \\cos\\varphi$ is the Josephson tunneling energy (which is $2\\pi$-periodic in the phase $\\varphi$ and provides the anharmonicity).

Perturbatively, the transmon’s level spacings are given by $\\hbar\\omega_{10} \\approx \\sqrt{8E_J E_C} - E_C$ for the 0→1 transition, and the next transition is $\\hbar\\omega_{21} \\approx \\sqrt{8E_J E_C} - 3E_C$ (this difference $E_C$ is the anharmonicity).

    "The coupling between a transmon qubit and the resonator is typically through a capacitive interaction. If the transmon is placed in or near a node of the resonator, an interaction of the form $g (c + c^\\dagger)(a + a^\\dagger)$ arises, where $c$ ($c^\\dagger$) is the annihilation (creation) operator for the qubit (treated as an oscillator or using the Jaynes-Cummings two-level approximation) and $a$ ($a^\\dagger$) for the resonator mode. For a two-level approximation of the qubit, this reduces to a Jaynes-Cummings type term $g(a,\\sigma_+ + a^\\dagger,\\sigma_-)$ as we introduced. Thus, the physics of a transmon coupled to a resonator mode is formally the same as the cavity QED Jaynes-Cummings model described earlier.\n",

We will illustrate these methods using the Jaynes–Cummings model from Chapter 2 as a running example, deriving the dispersive Hamiltonian and related shifts systematically.

    "\n",
    "### 3.2.2 Raman Processes and Comparison to Schrieffer–Wolff\n",
    "\n",
    "Adiabatic elimination is often used in multi-step processes like Raman transitions. For example, suppose you have two lower levels and one far-detuned upper level; if two lasers couple the lower levels to the upper one, you can eliminate the upper (which is never significantly populated if detuned) and get an effective direct coupling between the two lower levels (this is how a two-photon Raman transition works). The effective coupling (and Stark shifts) can be computed by adiabatic elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In circuit QED, an analogous scenario is if you have two qubits coupled via a bus resonator: if the bus is far off-resonant (dispersive regime), one can eliminate the bus to get a direct qubit–qubit coupling (like an $XX$ or $ZZ$ coupling depending on specifics). This is what was done historically for two-qubit gates (e.g., iSWAP with resonator bus: tune qubits in and out of resonance with bus). Adiabatic elimination gives a simple formula for the effective coupling $J$ between qubits: $J \\approx \\frac{g_1 g_2}{\\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2}$ (where $g_{1,2}$ are couplings of each qubit to resonator and $\\Delta_{1,2}$ their detunings). Indeed, in Section 4.2.1 we'll see using SW that we get such a $J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, the Schrieffer–Wolff method is essentially performing the same calculation but in a Hamiltonian (energy) approach rather than eliminating time derivatives. SW often yields the same effective Hamiltonian as adiabatic elimination yields from equations of motion. Adiabatic elimination is sometimes more intuitive for designing control sequences, whereas SW is systematic and keeps track of Hermiticity and higher order terms more systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Raman example (not detailed here due to focus on transmons), SW would show an effective second-order coupling between the two lower levels with strength $\\frac{\\Omega_1 \\Omega_2}{2\\Delta}$ (if $\\Omega$ are Rabi rates and $\\Delta$ detuning), plus Stark shifts; adiabatic elimination yields the same by solving steady state for the upper level amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, adiabatic elimination corroborates the SW results in the appropriate regime and is a good check. We used it to re-derive the dispersive JC effective Hamiltonian. Next, we will consider a third method: time-averaging, which is yet another way to derive effective Hamiltonians, especially useful for driven systems (like when we have a strong driving term oscillating in time).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Time-Averaging (Magnus Expansion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-averaging or the **Magnus expansion** is a technique to find an effective Hamiltonian when the actual Hamiltonian has explicit time dependence that is fast oscillating. If a Hamiltonian can be written as $H(t) = H_0 + V(t)$ where $V(t)$ oscillates rapidly (e.g., $V(t) = V e^{i\\omega t} + V^\\dagger e^{-i\\omega t}$ with large $\\omega$), then one can average over a period to find an effective static Hamiltonian that governs the slow dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is commonly used in NMR and driven systems: by moving into rotating frames or averaging high-frequency terms, one can capture phenomena like the Bloch–Siegert shift or create effective interactions (as in the concept of **Floquet engineering** in modern physics).\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific way is the **Magnus expansion**, which provides a perturbative expansion for the logarithm of the time evolution operator when the Hamiltonian is periodic or quasi-periodic. The first-order Magnus term is the time-average of the Hamiltonian; second-order terms involve commutators of integrals of the Hamiltonian at different times, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, here we'll likely apply a simpler “rotating wave” style average: basically re-derive the dispersive Hamiltonian by dropping fast oscillating terms, which we effectively already did in RWA. But we can also derive effective Hamiltonians for two-qubit interactions by averaging in an appropriate frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.1 Jaynes–Cummings via Time-Averaging\n",
    "\n",
    "We already applied a form of time-averaging when we invoked the RWA in Section 2.1: we said that terms oscillating at $\\omega_\\Sigma = \\omega_r + \\omega_q$ average out. One could formalize this by saying the effective Hamiltonian is the original Hamiltonian minus those terms (since their average is zero). That directly gave the JC Hamiltonian from the full Rabi Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can go further: to second order, the effect of those dropped terms (counter-rotating) can be captured by an averaged second-order Hamiltonian like $-\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_\\Sigma} (\\sigma_+ \\sigma_+ a a + \\sigma_- \\sigma_- a^\\dagger a^\\dagger)$ or something, which effectively yields the Bloch–Siegert shift after some transformation. This is an example of the Magnus expansion: the second-order term might produce that static shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-averaging might be more interesting for cases like the two-drive cross-resonance or bSWAP gates, where one applies a microwave and then averages out the fast oscillations to find an effective gate Hamiltonian. That is indeed how one often analyzes gates: treat the drive in a rotating frame and average out fast components to see the effective coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since Chapter 4 will cover specific gates, let's mention a simple use: if two qubits are fixed-coupled (always on $ZZ$ or $XX$ coupling), by driving one qubit at the frequency of the other (cross resonance), an effective interaction can be activated. The effective Hamiltonian can be derived by going into a frame rotating at the drive frequency and averaging. That yields terms like $ZX$ or $ZZ$ depending on detuning. We will see cross-resonance gate discussion in 4.3.2, presumably where time-averaging/Magnus is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a smaller example, imagine a two-level system driven by a strong microwave: $H(t) = \\frac{\\Omega}{2}( \\sigma_x \\cos\\omega t + \\sigma_y \\sin\\omega t)$ in the rotating frame of the qubit. By time-averaging one finds this yields a static term $\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\sigma_+$ in the frame if on resonance, or if off resonance yields something like $\\frac{\\Omega^2}{2\\Delta} \\sigma_z$ (AC Stark shift). That’s essentially what one does with average Hamiltonian theory in NMR (to design pulses). The results align with perturbation theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary**, time-averaging is a third perspective where one averages out rapidly oscillating terms to identify slower dynamics. In the limit of large detuning or high drive frequency, it matches the results of SW (which finds effective static interactions) and adiabatic elimination. All these methods, applied correctly, should yield consistent effective Hamiltonians.\n",

    "Each has its use cases. SW is very general and ensures the result is a proper Hermitian Hamiltonian. Adiabatic elimination is quick for simple systems and intuitive. Time-averaging is essential when dealing with driven systems or when designing control pulses and periodic modulations.\n",

    "## 3.4 Ordinary Perturbation Theory vs. SW\n",
    "\n",
    "One might wonder: why not just do straightforward non-degenerate perturbation theory on energy levels? The answer is: one can, but it becomes unwieldy for large systems and doesn’t directly give a Hamiltonian operator in the subspace. Non-degenerate perturbation theory (as in textbook quantum mechanics) would let you compute corrections to each energy eigenvalue and eigenstate order by order. In principle, if you only care about, say, the energy of the ground and first excited state of the coupled qubit–resonator system, you could do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could treat the coupling $g$ in JC as a perturbation and compute the second-order correction to the energy of $|0,0\\rangle$ (no photon, qubit ground). That correction would come from virtual transitions to $|1,1\\rangle$ (one photon, qubit excited) and yield $-\\frac{g^2}{\\Delta}$, giving $E_{00} \\approx -\\frac{\\omega_q}{2} - \\frac{g^2}{\\Delta}$ perhaps. Similarly the energy of $|0,1\\rangle$ (no photon, qubit excited) would shift by $+\\frac{g^2}{\\Delta}$. So the splitting between them becomes $\\omega_q - \\frac{2g^2}{\\Delta}$. That matches what we found for the $\\sigma_z$ term.\n",
    "\n",
    "So regular perturbation theory on energies does yield the dispersive shifts. But it has limitations: (1) it requires non-degenerate eigenstates to start with (imagine if $\\Delta$ were zero, then you'd need degenerate perturbation theory, which SW handles more gracefully in quasi-degenerate manner), and (2) to get an effective Hamiltonian operator (useful for dynamics, not just energies), one must also transform the states accordingly (which SW essentially does by giving $U = e^{-S}$ that transforms to the effective frame).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, SW *is* a form of degenerate perturbation theory (quasi-degenerate if blocks have multiple states) that yields not only energies but also effective operators (observables, etc.) in the reduced subspace.

In the next chapter, we will apply these insights to actual two-qubit gate schemes. We will see how specific driving or tuning strategies can turn these effective interactions on and off, enabling gate operations like iSWAP, bSWAP, and cross-resonance. Understanding the perturbative analysis will allow us to dissect those gates and identify the origin of terms like $ZZ$ interactions or conditional phases that are central to two-qubit gate performance."

    "As described in Section 2.2.3 of the thesis, the state of a qubit can be measured via microwave radiation on a cavity. However, the same physical interaction can be used in reverse to **coherently control a qubit via a microwave drive** without measuring it. In particular, if we drive the cavity far off-resonantly (detuned from the cavity by a large amount), we can manipulate the qubit state without significantly populating the cavity with real photons. In the dispersive regime, a drive at the qubit’s frequency causes only a *virtual* population of the cavity (mean photon number $n \\sim 0.1$ for typical parameters), enabling fast control without strong measurement back-action.\n",

    "* **Tunable qubit gates:** Those in which qubits’ frequencies (or their coupling) are **tuned in time** (typically via flux bias) to turn on and off an interaction.\n",
    "* **Fixed-frequency gates with microwave driving:** Those in which qubits remain at fixed frequencies with a fixed “always-on” coupling, and entanglement is generated by applying carefully chosen microwave drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. Tunable qubits (like flux-tunable transmons) allow one to *isolate* qubits when idle (far detuned, negligible interaction) and then bring them into resonance or near-resonance to enact a gate. This can make single-qubit control easier and turn off unwanted interactions during idle periods. A prime example is the **iSWAP gate** (Section 4.2.2), where two qubits are coupled via a resonator and only interact significantly when tuned into resonance with each other via flux control. However, tunable qubits require extra control lines and are susceptible to **flux noise**, potentially hurting coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-frequency schemes (always-on coupling), on the other hand, allow qubits to be parked at sweet spots for maximal coherence, and use microwave pulses to selectively activate interactions. Examples include the **Cross-Resonance gate** (Section 4.2.3) and two-transmon gates like **bSWAP** and **MAP** (Section 4.3). These avoid flux noise, but one must carefully manage the always-on coupling to avoid unwanted entanglement or **ZZ crosstalk** during idle operations. The cross-resonance gate, for instance, uses a drive on one qubit to mediate an effective interaction with another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we first derive a general **effective two-qubit Hamiltonian** for two qubits coupled via a resonator in the dispersive regime (using a second-order SW perturbation). This gives insight into the effective *ZZ coupling* and *exchange interactions* between qubits. We then discuss the iSWAP gate as an example of a tunable-qubit gate, and finally the cross-resonance gate as an example of an all-microwave gate.\n",

For example, one can choose block $A$ spanned by ${|0,0,n\\rangle, |1,1,n\\rangle}$ (both qubits in the same state, so total excitations even when including $n$ photons), and block $B$ spanned by ${|0,1,n\\rangle, |1,0,n\\rangle}$ (one qubit excited, the other not – an odd number of excitations in the qubits).

To facilitate this, one sets up a specific detuning between the qubits so that **$|00\\rangle$, $|11\\rangle$, and one of the $|20\\rangle$ or $|02\\rangle$ states form a low-energy manifold** that is relatively isolated from other levels. Concretely, suppose qubit 1 has frequency $\\omega_1$ and qubit 2 has $\\omega_2$ such that $\\Delta_{12} = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$ is approximately $-\\delta_1$ (the negative of qubit 1’s anharmonicity). In that case, the energy of $|20\\rangle$ (which is $2\\omega_1 - \\delta_1$ for qubit1 plus 0 for qubit2) is nearly the same as the energy of $|11\\rangle$ (which is $\\omega_1 + \\omega_2$). If $\\omega_1 > \\omega_2$ and $\\delta_i$ are positive (transmon anharmonicity is typically defined as a negative number in energy because $|1\\rangle\\to|2\\rangle$ is a lower frequency than $|0\\rangle\\to|1\\rangle$, but here they treat $\\delta$ as a positive parameter for absolute difference), then $\\Delta_{12} \\to -\\delta_1$ means $\\omega_1 - \\omega_2 \\approx -\\delta_1$, or $\\omega_1 + \\delta_1 \\approx \\omega_2$.

These three states then form a subspace where dynamics can be largely confined (if other levels are sufficiently far off-resonance). The $|20\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ coupling occurs via the always-on $J$ (which can couple $|20\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ by moving one excitation from qubit1 to qubit2).

The net effect is that the **transitions $|02\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |12\\rangle$ and $|01\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ etc. get slightly different frequencies**. This difference is encoded in a parameter $\\zeta$ (the ZZ shift). The thesis denotes $\\zeta = \\omega_{11} - \\omega_{01} - \\omega_{10}$, which is the difference between the frequency of $|1,1\\rangle \\to |0,1\\rangle$ plus $|1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0\\rangle$ vs the $|1,1\\rangle \\to |0,0\\rangle$ (which should be zero ideally). If $\\zeta \\neq 0$, it means $|11\\rangle$ has some extra energy relative to $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$ energies combined – which is exactly a ZZ coupling measure. They derive in the appendix (Appendix D) that:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "to leading orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\zeta_0$ is the static ZZ (existing with no drive), and $\\zeta_2$ is the extra part induced by the drive (of amplitude $\\Omega$ and detuning $\\delta = \\omega_d - (\\omega_2 + \\delta_2)$, presumably). They assume the drive is near the $|n2\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |n1\\rangle$ transition (maybe $|12\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ or similar, they'd mention \"drive almost resonant with the $|n2\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |n1\\rangle$ transition\"). Actually, they say a drive near the $|n,2\\rangle \\to |n,1\\rangle$ transitions induces a ZZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, $\\zeta$ being nonzero means the $|11\\rangle$ state picks up a phase relative to others over time. The MAP gate is exactly to accumulate a phase of $\\pi$ on $|11\\rangle$ relative to $|00\\rangle,|01\\rangle,|10\\rangle$. If $\\zeta$ is the rate of that phase difference, one would aim for $\\zeta \\Delta t = \\pi$. In the experiment, they indeed mention doing a Ramsey-type experiment: put qubit2 in a superposition, qubit1 either in $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$, drive the MAP interaction for some time $\\Delta t$, and see an extra phase if qubit1 was $|1\\rangle$. They show after $\\Delta t = 514$ ns, a phase difference of $\\pi$ accumulates between those cases (so a controlled-$Z$ gate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, they present the effective Hamiltonian in the computational subspace after the MAP gate as (Eq. 4.15):\n",

    "$$\n",
    "H_{\\text{eff}} = \\omega_{10}\\,|10\\rangle\\langle 10| + \\omega_{01}\\,|01\\rangle\\langle 01| + (\\omega_{10} + \\omega_{01} + \\zeta)\\,|11\\rangle\\langle 11| + \\text{const.}\n",

    "When $\\zeta \\Delta t = \\pi$, the unitary is $U = e^{-i \\pi/4 \\sigma_{z1}\\sigma_{z2}}$ up to single qubit phases. That is a CZ (since $e^{-i\\pi/4 ZZ} = \\operatorname{diag}(1,1,1,-1)$, which is a CZ gate up to global phase $-1$ on $|11\\rangle$ state). They indeed mention achieving a $ZZ_{\\pi}$ gate (which is a CZ) with $\\Delta t = 514$ ns, fidelity \\~87.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the MAP gate is essentially creating an *effective ZZ interaction* via a two-photon resonance and driving it. It’s an example of how *driving near a specific higher-level transition can induce a conditional phase without needing tunable flux bias*. However, leakage and decoherence limit fidelity (87.6% was reported).\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, by expanding our perturbative analysis to multi-level transmons, we can design and understand two-qubit gates that utilize higher levels. The Schrieffer-Wolff method remains extremely useful: it allows us to derive effective Hamiltonians where desired interactions (like $XX+YY$ for bSWAP or $ZZ$ for MAP) appear explicitly, and unwanted interactions can be identified and minimized by parameter choice or echoed out. The trade-off is that including higher levels introduces more opportunities for *leakage* (population leaving the computational subspace) and *dephasing* on those levels. These are active areas of optimization (pulse shaping to minimize leakage, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both bSWAP and MAP demonstrate that while the transmon’s weak anharmonicity complicates simple two-level gate models, it also provides **extra knobs** (additional resonances) that can be exploited to create entangling interactions that are otherwise forbidden in a purely harmonic system. The challenge is achieving high fidelity, which requires precision in meeting resonance conditions and mitigating decoherence during the gate.\n"
